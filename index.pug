        p Sustainability can feel pretty complicated. After a few minutes of research, you’re deep in a digital rabbit hole trying to digest the principles of thermal inertia or the latest advances in organic bioclimactic architecture. And wait — have you brushed up on the importance of selecting #[em responsibly sourced] grout to complement your home’s bathroom tiles?
        p #[strong The anatomy of a sustainable home isn’t actually as complex as you might think.] With some basic knowledge of thoughtful design, well-selected materials and insulation, and proper conservation techniques, you’ll see that a sustainable home isn’t out of reach. Just take a look inside.
